# Voting Repo
Voting systems modelled in C++.

This is for an upcoming project of mine where I want to intuitively explain the pros and cons of working with certain voting systems. These programs are designed to take in data from a Google Form exported to CSV, so the formatting of the voter data is assumed to have a header and instead of saying "Number of Votes for xyz" it instead lists the votes.

There are example data sets included in the repo, just for a sense of how things are to be formatted.
